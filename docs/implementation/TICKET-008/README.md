# TICKET-008: Kurrent DB Integration

## Overview

This ticket implements Kurrent DB integration for the Penguin Pool application, providing decentralized database functionality with support for multiple environments.

**Note**: Due to native dependencies in the Kurrent DB client package, this implementation uses a mock client for browser environments. The mock client provides the same API interface and can be easily replaced with the real client when running in Node.js environments.

## Objectives

- Install and configure Kurrent DB
- Create database connection and streams
- Implement basic CRUD operations
- Store user streams
- Support multiple environments (dev, staging, test, mainnet)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Kurrent DB Installation

- Added `@kurrent/kurrentdb-client` package to dependencies
- **Browser Compatibility**: Implemented mock client for browser environments
- Configured TypeScript types for Kurrent DB

### 2. Environment Configuration

- Created environment-specific configurations for:
  - Development (dev)
  - Staging (staging)
  - Testing (test)
  - Mainnet (mainnet)

### 3. Database Services

- `KurrentDBService`: Core database service with connection management
- `StreamService`: Handles stream operations and CRUD functionality
- `UserStreamService`: Manages user-specific stream operations
- **Mock Implementation**: Full-featured mock client for development and testing

### 4. Database Models

- `Stream`: Core stream data structure
- `UserStream`: User-specific stream metadata
- `DatabaseConfig`: Environment-specific database configuration

### 5. Store Integration

- `kurrentDBStore`: Pinia store for database state management
- Integration with existing user store

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Kurrent DB Configuration
VITE_KURRENT_DB_ENABLED=true
VITE_KURRENT_DB_ENVIRONMENT=dev
VITE_KURRENT_DB_SYNC_INTERVAL=5000
VITE_KURRENT_DB_MAX_RETRIES=3
VITE_KURRENT_DB_TIMEOUT=30000
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Stream Operations

```typescript
import { useKurrentDBStore } from '@/features/kurrentDB'

const dbStore = useKurrentDBStore()

// Create a stream
await dbStore.createStream({
  name: 'User Profile',
  data: { userId: '123', profile: { name: 'John' } },
})

// Read stream data
const stream = await dbStore.getStream('stream-id')

// Update stream
await dbStore.updateStream('stream-id', { data: { updated: true } })

// Delete stream
await dbStore.deleteStream('stream-id')
```

### User Stream Management

```typescript
import { useUserStreamService } from '@/features/kurrentDB'

const userStreamService = useUserStreamService()

// Store user data
await userStreamService.storeUserData('user-id', {
  profile: { name: 'John' },
  preferences: { theme: 'dark' },
})

// Retrieve user data
const userData = await userStreamService.getUserData('user-id')
```

## Mock Implementation

### Why Mock?

The Kurrent DB client package contains native binary dependencies that cannot run in browser environments. To provide a seamless development experience, we've implemented a full-featured mock client that:

- **Simulates Real Behavior**: Mimics connection delays, errors, and data persistence
- **Maintains API Compatibility**: Uses the exact same interface as the real client
- **Supports All Features**: Implements CRUD operations, filtering, and health checks
- **Easy to Replace**: Can be swapped with the real client in Node.js environments

### Mock Features

- ✅ Connection management with simulated delays
- ✅ In-memory data storage with proper CRUD operations
- ✅ Filtering and pagination support
- ✅ Health monitoring and metrics
- ✅ Error handling and validation
- ✅ Realistic timing simulation

## Testing

- Unit tests for all services and stores
- Integration tests for database operations
- Environment-specific test configurations
- Mock client testing with realistic scenarios

## Next Steps

- Implement advanced querying capabilities
- Add data validation and sanitization
- Implement backup and recovery mechanisms
- Add monitoring and analytics
- **Production Deployment**: Replace mock client with real client in Node.js environments
