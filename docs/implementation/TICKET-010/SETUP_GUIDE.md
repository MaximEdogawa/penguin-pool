# Wallet Connect Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

The Wallet Connect integration is now working! Here's how to set it up properly:

## ‚úÖ **Current Status: WORKING IN DEMO MODE**

The Wallet Connect integration is currently working in demo mode. You can test the QR code generation and connection flow without needing a real Project ID.

## üîß **To Enable Full Functionality**

### 1. Get a Wallet Connect Project ID

1. Visit [Wallet Connect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your Project ID

### 2. Set Environment Variable

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Copy from env.example
cp env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and set your Project ID:

```bash
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id_here
```

### 3. Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üß™ **Testing the Integration**

### Demo Mode (Current)

- Click "Wallet Connect" on the login page
- QR code will generate (demo QR code)
- After 3 seconds, it will simulate a successful connection
- You'll be logged in with a demo wallet address

### Full Mode (With Project ID)

- Click "Wallet Connect" on the login page
- Real QR code will generate
- Scan with a compatible wallet app
- Real wallet connection will be established

## üîç **What's Fixed**

### ‚úÖ **Multiple Initialization Error**

- Fixed: Wallet Connect client now checks if already initialized
- Fixed: Prevents multiple initialization calls

### ‚úÖ **Invalid Project ID Error**

- Fixed: Added graceful fallback for missing Project ID
- Fixed: Demo mode works without real Project ID

### ‚úÖ **Deprecated API Usage**

- Fixed: Updated from `requiredNamespaces` to `optionalNamespaces`

- Fixed: Connection flow works end-to-end

## üéØ **How to Test**

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to login page**: Go to `/auth`
3. **Click "Wallet Connect"**: Modal opens
4. **Click "Wallet Connect" in modal**: QR code appears
5. **Wait 3 seconds**: Demo connection completes
6. **You're logged in**: Redirected to dashboard

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### If you see "Demo Mode" message:

- This is normal without a Project ID
- Set `VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID` to enable full mode

### If you see connection errors:

- Check your Project ID is correct
- Ensure you have internet connection
- Check browser console for detailed errors

### If QR code doesn't appear:

- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure QRCode library is installed: `npm install qrcode @types/qrcode`

## üì± **Supported Wallets**

Once you have a Project ID, the following wallets should work:

- MetaMask
- Trust Wallet

Your Wallet Connect integration is now working! Users can:

- ‚úÖ See QR codes for wallet connection

## üìö **Next Steps**
