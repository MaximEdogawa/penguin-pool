# Wallet Connect Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status: DEMO MODE WORKING

The Wallet Connect integration is currently working in **demo mode**. You can see QR codes and test the connection flow, but it won't connect to real wallets until you set up a Project ID.

### Step 1: Get a Wallet Connect Project ID

1. Go to [Wallet Connect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com)

   - **Project Description**: Decentralized lending platform
   - **Project URL**: http://localhost:3000 (for development)
6. Click "Create Project"
7. Copy your **Project ID** (looks like: `c4f79f8214d29d8f8abf4d40a5c0b9c7`)

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Project ID:

```bash
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
